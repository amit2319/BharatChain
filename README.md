## Problem Introduction

BharatChain is private blockchain demonstrating Direct Social Benefits and Corporate Allowances, made using HyperLedger Composer and HyperLedger Composer PlayGround.

The Admin in our case the Government can issue cryptocurrency to any registered organization, individual. It can be used to add specific constraints on the asset issued, which allows it to be spent only when those constraint matches.

For Instance, Government subsidises huge amount of money in value, that need to be adjusted by government by paying to organization, or any individual. These scenarios are susceptible to frauds and corruption.

Take a case, when government provide funds to individual or organization for specific cause, like Funds allotted for Ration to Citizens under Below Poverty Line category, or scholarship awarded to deserving candidates for things like Education etc. When funds are allocated directly to the entity, there may be a possibility of the funds to be misused by the individual or other family member for other things, that doesn't serve the purpose of
the allocated funds.

Fund provided by government to its organization for specific operation, could be misused for individual means any traces can be altered easily by them.

Letâ€™s look at another case, an instance of BharatChain can also be deployed for Private Organizations for managing allowances of its employees, it help in making the allowance restrict to its type.

BharatChain helps in all such instances where fraud, corruption and misuse of alloted funds take place. It helps in resisting corruption by self managing ledger on the private blockchain ('Bharat-Chain') that cannot be altered by third party. Also, different government entities can allow an individual for allowance benefit. Thus, different entities can function independently and funds are allocated and spent.as planned.

Corruption is the biggest and most dangerous problem of the India. The big chunk of it is from the Funds allotted by government. There are many cases in the past in India that can be referred to. Rather than within the government departments,It also prevails in General Public with small funds allocated to individual for specific needs but abused by them.

Funds allocated with careful planning should reflect in the progress, either for an
organizations or an individual. Blockchain Technology helps in this problem
by ensuring that the purpose of those funds are served, and when it happens
it naturally resonates.


## Technical Specifications
